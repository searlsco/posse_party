    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have exactly one inbox for reading blogs and following news, and it's expressly <em>not</em> my e-mail client—it's my feed reader. (Looking for a recommendation? <a href="/rss/#how-do-i-follow-a-feed">Here are some instructions on setting up NetNewsWire</a>; for once, the best app is also the free and open source one.)</p>
<p>Anyway, with the rise of Substack and the trend for writers to eschew traditional web publishing in favor of e-mail newsletters, more and more publishers want to tangle their content up in your e-mail. Newsletters work because people will see them (so long as they ever check their e-mail…), whereas routinely visiting a web site requires a level of discipline that social media trained out of most people a decade ago.</p>
<p>But, if you're like me, and you want to reserve your e-mail for <em>bidirectional communication with humans</em> and prefer to read news at the time and pace of your choosing, did you know you can <strong>convert just about any e-mail newsletter into an RSS feed</strong> and follow that instead?</p>
<p>Many of us nerds have known about this for a while, and while various services have tried to monetize the same feature, it's hard to beat <a href="https://kill-the-newsletter.com/">Kill the Newsletter</a>: it doesn't require an account to set up and it's totally free.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-convert-an-e-mail-newsletter-into-a-feed">
    <a class="font-bold no-underline text-primary hover:underline" href="#how-to-convert-an-e-mail-newsletter-into-a-feed">How to convert an e-mail newsletter into a feed</a>
</h2>
<p>Suppose you're signed up to the present author's free monthly newsletter, <a href="/newsletter/">Searls of Wisdom</a>, and you want to start reading it in a feed reader. (Also suppose that I do not <a href="https://justin.searls.co/mails.xml">already publish an RSS feed alternative</a>, which I do).</p>
<p>Here's what you can do:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Visit <a href="https://kill-the-newsletter.com/">Kill the Newsletter</a> and enter the human-readable title you want for the newsletter. In this case you might type <strong>Searls of Wisdom</strong> and and click <code>Create Feed</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This yields two generated strings: an e-mail address and a feed URL</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Copy the e-mail address (e.g. <code>1234@kill-the-newsletter.com</code>) and <em>subscribe to the newsletter</em> via the publisher's web site, just as you would if you were giving them your real e-mail address</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Copy the URL (e.g. <code>https://kill-the-newsletter.com/feeds/1234.xml</code>) and subscribe to it in your feed reader, as if it was any normal RSS/Atom feed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Confirm it's working by checking the feed in your RSS reader. Because this approach simply recasts e-mails into RSS entries, the first thing you see will probably be a welcome message or a confirmation link you'll need to click to verify your subscription</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once it's working, if you'd previously subscribed to the newsletter with your personal e-mail address, <em>unsubscribe</em> from it and check it in your feed reader instead</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That's it! Subscribing to a newsletter with a bogus-looking address so that a bogus-looking feeds starts spitting out articles is a little counter-intuitive, I admit, but I have faith in you.</p>
<p>(And remember, you don't need to do this for my newsletter, which already <a href="https://justin.searls.co/mails.xml">offers a feed you can just follow</a> without the extra steps.)</p>
<p>Why is Kill the Newsletter free? How can any of this be sustainable? Nobody knows! Isn't the Internet cool?</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Loved this post from <a href="https://www.joanwestenberg.com/p/smart-people-don-t-chase-goals-they-create-limits">Joan Westenberg</a>, about the limitations of goals:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The cult of goal-setting thrives in this illusion. It converts uncertainty into an illusion of progress. It demands specificity in exchange for comfort. And it replaces self-trust with the performance of future-planning. That makes it wildly appealing to organizations, executives, and knowledge workers who want to feel like they're doing something without doing anything unpredictable.</p></blockquote>
<p>And the liberation of constraints:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Constraints make solutions non-obvious. They force the kind of second-order thinking that goals actively discourage. Instead of aiming for a finish line, the constrained mind seeks viability. It doesn't ask, &quot;How do I get there?&quot; It asks, &quot;What's possible from here?&quot;</p></blockquote>
<p>My first corporate job required me to set annual goals for myself. I still remember them, both because I spent all summer trying to think of easy ones and because I nevertheless accomplished zero of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Speak at a Java user group</li>
<li>Teach basic finances to kids via the Junior Achievement organization</li>
<li>Host 5 lunch-and-learns for my department</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the best managers I ever had didn't give a fuck about my goals (in fact, he never even bothered to inform me he was my manager). On day one of my first project he threw out some random ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why not require all production code be pair-programmed instead of reviewed after-the-fact?</li>
<li>What if no method in the codebase was allowed to be longer than 3 lines?</li>
<li>You're hitting 100% code coverage in Java, but why do you have zero JavaScript tests?</li>
</ul>
<p>The last thing he said killed me: <em>why do people sweat hours over every last test of their server-side code but give zero shits slinging thousands of lines of untested jQuery spaghetti?</em> That constraint—of forcing myself to apply my testing zealotry to the front-end—is what led to my initial open source contributions and my speaking career. It's why I wrote my first <a href="https://github.com/searls/jasmine-maven-plugin">widely-adopted open source project</a>. It was also the topic of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeqPTG8dps8">my first talk at a Ruby conference</a>. I proceeded to spend the next few years becoming &quot;the JavaScript testing guy&quot; in half a dozen different software communities.</p>
<p>I'm honestly not sure where I'd be if it hadn't been for that passing comment, but I am absolutely certain that applying a constraint was more effective than setting a goal would have been.</p>

<p>I don't scroll reels, so I'd hardly call myself a well-heeled critic of <em>the form</em>, but I will say I've never heard truer words spoken in a vertical short-form video.</p>
<p>It might be helpful to think of the harmony we witness in Japan as a collective bank account with an exceptionally high balance. Everyone deposits into that account all the ingredients necessary for maintaining a harmonious society. Withdrawals are rare, because to take anything <em>out</em> of that bank account effectively amounts to unilaterally deciding to spend <em>everyone's</em> money. As a result, acts of selfishness—especially those that disrupt that harmony—will frequently elicit shame and admonition from others.</p>
<p>Take trash, for example. Suppose the AA batteries in your Walkman die. There are few public trash cans, so:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>If you're visiting Japan –</strong> at the next train platform, you'll see a garbage bin labeled &quot;Others&quot; and toss those batteries in there without a second thought</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If you're living in Japan –</strong> you'll carry the batteries around all day, bring them home, sort and clean them, pay for a small trash bag for hazardous materials (taxed at 20x the rate of a typical bag), and then wait until the next hazardous waste collection day (which could be <em>up to 3 months</em> in some areas)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So which of these scenarios is more fun? Visiting, of course!</p>
<p>But what you don't see as a visitor is that nearly every public trash can is provided as a service to customers, and it's <em>someone's literal job</em> to go through each trash bag. So while the visitor experience above is relatively seamless, some little old lady might be tasked with sorting and disposing of the train station's trash every night. And when she finds your batteries, she won't just have to separate them from the rest of the trash, she may well have to fill out a form requisitioning a hazardous waste bag, or call the municipal garbage collection agency to schedule a pick-up. This is all in addition to the little old lady's <em>other responsibilities</em>—<strong>it doesn't take many instances of people failing to follow societal expectations to seriously stress the entire system</strong>.</p>
<p>This is why Japanese people are rightly concerned about over-tourism: foreigners rarely follow any of the norms that keep their society humming. Over the past 15 years, many tourist hotspots have reached the breaking point. Osaka and Kyoto just aren't the cities they once were. There just aren't the public funds and staffing available to keep up with the amount of daily disorder caused by tourists failing to abide by Japan's mostly-unspoken societal customs.</p>
<p>It's also why Japanese residents feel hopeless about the situation. The idea of foreign tourists learning and adhering to proper etiquette is facially absurd. Japan's economy is increasingly dependent on tourism dollars, so closing off the borders isn't feasible. The dominant political party lacks the creativity to imagine more aggressive policies than a hilariously paltry <a href="https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2025/03/0b5f58e5e464-japan-approves-lodging-tax-in-11-more-areas-as-tourism-booms.html">$3-a-night hotel taxes</a>. Couple this with the ongoing depopulation crisis, and people quite reasonably worry that all the things that make Japan such a lovely place to visit are coming apart at the seams.</p>

Everyone deposits into that account all the ingredients necessary for maintaining a harmonious society. Withdrawals are rare, because to take anything \u003cem\u003eout\u003c/em\u003e of that bank account effectively amounts to unilaterally deciding to spend \u003cem\u003eeveryone's\u003c/em\u003e money. As a result, acts of selfishness—especially those that disrupt that harmony—will frequently elicit shame and admonition from others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTake trash, for example. Suppose the AA batteries in your Walkman die. There are few public trash cans, so:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you're visiting Japan –\u003c/strong\u003e at the next train platform, you'll see a garbage bin labeled \u0026quot;Others\u0026quot; and toss those batteries in there without a second thought\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you're living in Japan –\u003c/strong\u003e you'll carry the batteries around all day, bring them home, sort and clean them, pay for a small trash bag for hazardous materials (taxed at 20x the rate of a typical bag), and then wait until the next hazardous waste collection day (which could be \u003cem\u003eup to 3 months\u003c/em\u003e in some areas)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo which of these scenarios is more fun? Visiting, of course!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut what you don't see as a visitor is that nearly every public trash can is provided as a service to customers, and it's \u003cem\u003esomeone's literal job\u003c/em\u003e to go through each trash bag. So while the visitor experience above is relatively seamless, some little old lady might be tasked with sorting and disposing of the train station's trash every night. And when she finds your batteries, she won't just have to separate them from the rest of the trash, she may well have to fill out a form requisitioning a hazardous waste bag, or call the municipal garbage collection agency to schedule a pick-up. This is all in addition to the little old lady's \u003cem\u003eother responsibilities\u003c/em\u003e—\u003cstrong\u003eit doesn't take many instances of people failing to follow societal expectations to seriously stress the entire system\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is why Japanese people are rightly concerned about over-tourism: foreigners rarely follow any of the norms that keep their society humming. Over the past 15 years, many tourist hotspots have reached the breaking point. Osaka and Kyoto just aren't the cities they once were. There just aren't the public funds and staffing available to keep up with the amount of daily disorder caused by tourists failing to abide by Japan's mostly-unspoken societal customs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt's also why Japanese residents feel hopeless about the situation. The idea of foreign tourists learning and adhering to proper etiquette is facially absurd. Japan's economy is increasingly dependent on tourism dollars, so closing off the borders isn't feasible. The dominant political party lacks the creativity to imagine more aggressive policies than a hilariously paltry \u003ca href=\"https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2025/03/0b5f58e5e464-japan-approves-lodging-tax-in-11-more-areas-as-tourism-booms.html\"\u003e$3-a-night hotel taxes\u003c/a\u003e. Couple this with the ongoing depopulation crisis, and people quite reasonably worry that all the things that make Japan such a lovely place to visit are coming apart at the seams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway, for anyone who wonders why I tend to avoid the areas of Japan popular with foreigners, there you go.\u003c/p\u003e","id":"https://justin.searls.co/posts/visiting-japan-is-easy-because-living-in-japan-is-hard/","og_image":"https://justin.searls.co/img/social/posts/visiting-japan-is-easy-because-living-in-japan-is-hard.jpg","platform_overrides":{"instagram":{"syndicate":false}},"published_at":"2025-06-27T13:37:41Z","title":"Visiting Japan is easy because living in Japan is hard","updated_at":"2025-06-27T10:56:00-04:00","url":"https://justin.searls.co/posts/visiting-japan-is-easy-because-living-in-japan-is-hard/"}]]></posse:post>

<blockquote>
<p>For like 2 years (ever since Oppenheimer came out)? I listened to ONE EPISODE of Script Notes by manually navigating to it in the Podcasts app and listening to it. Now, across all my devices—iPad, iPhone, and every Mac, as if it's on some kind of bizarre timer, the Podcasts app will launch to the Script Notes page. Sometimes it's once a week, sometimes I go a month without seeing it. Always happens while I'm actively using the device and steals focus. This has been annoying and confusing for years, but it's so erratic that I assumed nobody at Apple would ever look at it and figure it out. Nothing I do changes anything: I've followed/unfollowed and downloaded/removed to try to shake something loose, but nope. Keeps launching to this random podcast I don't listen to</p>
<p>As of macOS 26, however, this is the first time it actually breaks the app by showing this modal dialog with no views or controls on it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Neat. 💣</p>

Sometimes it's once a week, sometimes I go a month without seeing it. Always happens while I'm actively using the device and steals focus. This has been annoying and confusing for years, but it's so erratic that I assumed nobody at Apple would ever look at it and figure it out. Nothing I do changes anything: I've followed/unfollowed and downloaded/removed to try to shake something loose, but nope. Keeps launching to this random podcast I don't listen to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs of macOS 26, however, this is the first time it actually breaks the app by showing this modal dialog with no views or controls on it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeat. 💣\u003c/p\u003e\n","id":"https://justin.searls.co/shots/2025-06-26-16h02m29s/","media":[{"type":"image","url":"https://justin.searls.co/shots/-111fc82.jpeg"},{"type":"image","url":"https://justin.searls.co/shots/-39a0979.jpeg"}],"og_image":"https://justin.searls.co/shots/-111fc82.jpeg","platform_overrides":{},"published_at":"2025-06-26T20:02:29Z","title":"My favorite Apple Podcasts bug","updated_at":"2025-06-26T16:05:41-04:00","url":"https://justin.searls.co/shots/2025-06-26-16h02m29s/"}]]></posse:post>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I get asked from time to time about the t-shirts I wear every day, so I figured it might save time to document it here.</p>
<p>The correct answer to the question is, &quot;whatever the cheapest blank tri-blend crew-neck is.&quot; The blend in question refers to a mix of fabrics: cotton, polyester, and rayon. The brand you buy doesn't really matter, since they're all going to be pretty much the same: cheap, lightweight, quick-drying, don't retain odors, and feel surprisingly good on the skin for the price. This type of shirt was popularized by the <a href="https://retail.americanapparel.com/tri-blend-crewneck-track-t-shirt/">American Apparel Track Shirt</a>, but that company went to shit at some point and I haven't bothered with any of its post-post-bankruptcy wares.</p>
<p>I maintain a roster of 7 active shirts that I rotate daily and wash weekly. Every 6 months I replace them. I buy 14 at a time so I only need to order annually. I always get them from <a href="https://www.blankapparel.com">Blank Apparel</a>, because they don't print bullshit logos on anything and charge near-wholesale prices. I can usually load up on a year's worth of shirts for just over $100.</p>
<p>I can vouch for these two specific models:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nextlevelapparel.com/products/unisex-tri-blend-t-shirt-envy">Next Level 6010</a> (<a href="https://www.blankapparel.com/t-shirts/short-sleeve-t-shirts/next-level-apparel/6010-triblend-t-shirt">Blank Apparel</a>)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.bellacanvas.com/product/3413/Unisex-Triblend-SS-Tee.html">Bella+Canvas 3413</a> (<a href="https://www.blankapparel.com/t-shirts/short-sleeve-t-shirts/bella-canvas/3413-unisex-tri-blend-t-shirt">Blank Apparel</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The Next Level shirts feel slightly nicer on day one, but they also wear faster and will feel a little scratchy after three months of daily usage. The Bella+Canvas ones seem to hold up a bit better. But, honestly, who cares. The whole point is clothes don't matter and people will get used to anything after a couple days. They're cheap and cover my nipples, so mission accomplished.</p>]]></content>

<p>Well, as of today, POSSE Party officially posts to just about everything I could want it to. This week, I locked myself in a tiny Tokyo apartment and didn't let myself out until I'd finished building support for Instagram, Facebook Pages, LinkedIn, and YouTube.

<p>I'm excited and relieved to have realized the vision of what I set out to build. I'll be discussing what's next… soon-ish. Probably.</p>

This gives you superpowers.</p></blockquote>
<p>I've written a lot of commentary on posts covering the angles enumerated above, and much less about just how many fucking to-dos and rainy day list items I've managed to clear this year with the help of coding tools like ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and Cursor. Thanks to AI, stuff that's been clogging up my backlog for years was done quickly and correctly.</p>
<p>When I write <code>code org-name/repo</code>, I now have a script that finds the correct project directory and selects its preferred editor, and launches it with the appropriate environment loaded. When I write <code>git pump</code>, I finally have a script that'll pull, commit, and push in one shot (stopping for a <code>Y/n</code> confirmation only if the changes appear to be nontrivial). I've also finally implemented a comprehensive <a href="https://www.backblaze.com/blog/the-3-2-1-backup-strategy/">3-2-1 backup strategy</a> and scheduled it to run on our Macs each night, thanks to a script that rsyncs my and Becky's most important directories to a massive SSD RAID array, then to a local NAS, and finally to cloud storage.</p>
<p>Each of these was a thing I'd meant to get around to for years but never did, because they were never the most important thing to do. But I could set an agent to work on each of them while I checked my mail or whatever and only spend 20 or 30 minutes of my own time to put the finishing touches on them. All without having to remember arcane shell scripting incantations (since that's outside my wheelhouse).</p>
<p>For now, I only really feel so supercharged when it comes to one-off scripts and the leaf nodes of my applications, but even if that's <em>all AI tools are ever any good for</em> that's still a fucking lot of stuff. Especially as a guy who used his one chance to give a keynote at RailsConf to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rm8RYzrVkFA">exhort developers to maximize the number of leaf nodes in their applications</a>.</p>

When I write \u003ccode\u003egit pump\u003c/code\u003e, I finally have a script that'll pull, commit, and push in one shot (stopping for a \u003ccode\u003eY/n\u003c/code\u003e confirmation only if the changes appear to be nontrivial). I've also finally implemented a comprehensive \u003ca href=\"https://www.backblaze.com/blog/the-3-2-1-backup-strategy/\"\u003e3-2-1 backup strategy\u003c/a\u003e and scheduled it to run on our Macs each night, thanks to a script that rsyncs my and Becky's most important directories to a massive SSD RAID array, then to a local NAS, and finally to cloud storage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach of these was a thing I'd meant to get around to for years but never did, because they were never the most important thing to do. But I could set an agent to work on each of them while I checked my mail or whatever and only spend 20 or 30 minutes of my own time to put the finishing touches on them. All without having to remember arcane shell scripting incantations (since that's outside my wheelhouse).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor now, I only really feel so supercharged when it comes to one-off scripts and the leaf nodes of my applications, but even if that's \u003cem\u003eall AI tools are ever any good for\u003c/em\u003e that's still a fucking lot of stuff.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week's <a href="https://www.theverge.com/the-vergecast">Vergecast</a> did a great job summarizing the current state of affairs for web publishers grappling with the more-rapidly-than-they'd-hoped impending arrival of &quot;Google Zero.&quot; Don't know what Google Zero is? Basically, it describes a seemingly-inevitable future where the number of times Google Search links out to domains not owned by Google asymptotically approaches zero. This is bad news for publishers, who depend on Google for a huge proportion of their traffic (and they depend on that traffic for making money off display ads).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lrl0t9FkBns&amp;t=3139s">The whole segment</a> is a good primer on where things stand:</p>
<div class="relative pb-[56.25%] h-0 -ml-1 -mr-1 bg-secondary md:ml-0 md:mr-0 md:beneath-the-page">
  <iframe class="absolute top-0 left-0 w-full h-full" width="100%" height="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lrl0t9FkBns?start=3139" loading="lazy" title="Google Zero and AI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<p>My recollection is that everyone could see the writing on the wall as early as the mid-2010s when Google introduced &quot;<a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/9351707?hl=en">Featured Snippets</a>&quot; and other iterations of instant answers that obviated the need for users to click links. Publishers had a decade to think up some other way to make money since then, but appear to have done approximately nothing to prepare for a world where their traffic doesn't come from Google.</p>
<p>To the SEO industry, such a world doesn't make sense—you can increase your PageRank one-hundredfold and one hundred times zero is still zero.</p>
<p>To younger workers in publishing, a world without Google is almost impossible to imagine, as it has come to dominate almost every stage of advertising and distribution.</p>
<p>To old-school publishers who can remember what paper feels like, they only recently reached the end of a 20-year journey to migrate from a paid subscription relationship with readers to a free ad-supported situationship with tech platforms that consider their precious content an undifferentiated commodity. Publishers would love to go back, but the world has changed—nobody wants to pay for articles written by people they don't know.</p>
<p>The only people who are thriving are those who developed a patronage followership based on affinity for their individual identities. They've got a Patreon or a Substack and some of the most well-known journalists are making a 5-20x multiple of whatever their salary at Vox or GameSpot was. But if your income depends on the web publishing dynamic as it (precariously) exists today and you <em>didn't</em> spend the last decade making a name for yourself, you are <em>well and truly fucked</em>. Alas.</p>
<p>None of this is new if you read the news about the news.</p>
<p>What <em>is</em> new is that Google is answering more and more queries with AI summaries (and soon, one-shot web apps generated on the fly). As a result, the transition to Google Zero appears to be happening much more quickly than people expected/feared. Despite reporting on this eventuality for a decade, web publishers appear to have been caught flat-footed and have tended to respond with some combination of <a href="https://thedesk.net/2025/05/google-search-business-insider-layoffs/">interminable layoffs</a> and <a href="https://www.thekeyword.co/news/googles-ai-search-shift-causes-traffic-drop-for-news-publishers">hopeless doom-saying</a>.</p>
<p>This quote from Hemingway's <em>The Sun Also Rises</em> never gets old and applies well here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;How did you go bankrupt?&quot; Bill asked.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Two ways,&quot; Mike said. &quot;Gradually and then suddenly.&quot;</p></blockquote>
<p>Fortunately, the monetization strategy for <a href="https://justin.searls.co">justin.searls.co</a> is immune to these pressures, as I'm happy to do all the shit I do for free for some reason.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In 2011, the same month Todd and I decided to start <a href="https://testdouble.com">Test Double</a>, Steve Jobs had recently died, and we both happened to watch Steve Jobs' incredible 2005 Stanford commencement speech. Among the flurry of remembrances and articles being posted at the time, the video of this speech in particular broke through and became the lodestone for those moved by his passing.</p>
<p>The humble &quot;just three stories&quot; structure, the ephemera described in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs_(book)">Isaacson's book</a>, and the folklore about Steve's brooding in the run-up to the speech became almost as powerful as his actual words. The fact that Jobs, the ruthlessly focused product visionary and unflinching pitchman, was himself incredibly nervous about this speech might be the most humanizing thing any of us have ever heard about him.</p>
<p>Well, it's been twenty years, and the Steve Jobs Archive has written <a href="https://stevejobsarchive.com/exhibits/stay-hungry-stay-foolish">something of a coda on it</a>. They've also released <a href="https://stevejobsarchive.com/artifact/steves-drafts">the e-mails Steve wrote to himself</a> in lieu of proper notes (perhaps the second-most humanizing thing). They've also spruced up and remastered the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiHZqamCD8c">video of the speech itself</a> on YouTube.</p>
<p>Looking through his e-mails, I found I actually prefer this draft phrasing on the relieving clarity of our impending demise:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most important thing I've ever encountered to help me make big choices is to remember that I'll be dead soon.</p></blockquote>
<p>In 2011, Todd and I ran out of good reasons not to take the leap and do what we could to make some small difference in how people wrote software. In 2025, I believe we're now at an inflection point that we haven't seen since then. If you can see a path forward to meet this moment and make a meaningful impact, <strong>do it</strong>. Don't worry, you'll be dead soon.</p>
<p>I've never regretted failing to succeed; I've only regretted failing to try.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you just read this month's <a href="/newsletter/">newsletter</a>, you might have gotten the impression <em>whoa, it's really hard as a foreigner to buy property in Japan</em>. And the fact it took me over a month, mostly on-site, to enter into contract to buy a condo in cash should serve as ample evidence of that.</p>
<p>However, multiple seemingly conflicting things can be true at once, and Bloomberg's Gearoid Reidy calls out several great points in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2025-05-26/it-s-too-easy-for-foreigners-to-buy-property-in-japan">a saucy column</a> (<a href="https://archive.is/YcYAT#selection-1545.83-1545.440">archive link</a>) which he wrote <em>after</em> I got myself into this mess:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But increasingly, the spotlight is falling on foreign buyers, <a href="https://japan-forward.com/foreign-population-in-tokyo-soars-as-chinese-buyers-seek-condos/">particularly</a> wealthy <a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/china/chinese-residents-move-japan-311d8557">Chinese</a>, seeking a safe place for their capital and drawn by Japan's political stability and social safety net. Lawmakers and commentators have been <a href="https://news.goo.ne.jp/article/sankei/politics/sankei-_politics_policy_5UDDFOOIUFEHVI7B6SMNNTR7BU.html">raising</a> the lack of restrictions on property in parliament in recent weeks, as well as in the media. Former international soccer-star-turned-investor Keisuke Honda summed up what many think when he recently <a href="https://x.com/kskgroup2017/status/1896764919753891883">tweeted</a> that he thought foreigners should not be allowed to buy land here.</p></blockquote>
<p>Japan wouldn't be alone in seeing foreign non-residents snap up a bunch of attractive real estate—whether to park capital in a stable economy or to exploit increased tourism by flooding the zone with cheap Airbnb listings. What's different is that Japan's government does almost nothing to document, constrain, or tax foreign buyers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amazingly, it was only this decade that Japan first began making it harder for foreigners to buy properties even in sensitive areas next to military bases or nuclear plants. Beyond that, it's open season: Buyers don't even have to be resident in the country, there are no additional taxes or stamp duties for foreign purchasers, nor are there extra levies for second or holiday homes.</p>
<p>Japan is an outlier in the region. Singapore doubled its stamp duty on foreign buyers to 60% in 2023 as part of a series of disincentives, while Hong Kong only recently removed a similar curb in an effort to breathe life into the property market. Elsewhere, Australia announced a two-year outright ban on foreigners buying some homes, a step Canada last year extended.</p></blockquote>
<p>All of this is genuinely surprising when you consider Japan's general hesitation around immigration. The suppressed value of the yen over the last four years has only exacerbated the issue and led to a run on housing inventory since 2021. Nevertheless, over-tourism has gotten far more attention from the media—pointing a camera at throngs of poorly-behaved white people outside Sensoji Temple makes for better TV than footage of largely-empty luxury condominiums popping up on every corner in Nakameguro.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the barriers to buying real estate in Japan have less to do with legal restrictions or taxes and more to do with language, culture, and the lack of comprehensive regulation against discrimination. What this adds up to is that real estate agencies specializing in serving foreign buyers and for which there are dozens in Tokyo specifically (many marketing to a single locale like Singapore or Hong Kong), can do deals all day long while asking almost nothing of the buyer beyond the funds for the purchase. However, there are very few such real estate agents outside Tokyo and a handful of foreign-friendly mid-market metros like Fukuoka.</p>
<p>Once you venture outside Tokyo, if you intend to buy <em>desirable homes or new construction</em> (i.e. not an abandoned house in the middle of nowhere), few realtors will have experience dealing with foreign non-residents and, regardless, many developers will insist on working with buyers directly—which means foreigners are often boxed out entirely. (<a href="https://toyokeizai.net/articles/-/622362">About 40% of foreign buyers report</a> having been turned away as a result of not being Japanese.)</p>
<p>Anyway, Gearoid describes a very real affordability crisis. Many Japanese workers with well-paid jobs have lost all hope of ever becoming homeowners despite a rapidly-declining population. Personally, I wouldn't be thrilled to have to pay more in tax when our purchase closes, but I'd completely understand and support the policy outcome such a tax would serve.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>WWDC 2025 delivered on the one thing I was hoping to see from WWDC 2024: free, unlimited invocation of Apple's on-device language models by developers. It may have arrived later than I would have liked, but all it took was the first few code examples from the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2025/102">Platforms State of the Union presentation</a> to convince me that the wait was worth it.</p>
<p>Assuming you're too busy to be bothered to watch the keynote, much less the SOTU undercard presentation, here are the four bits of Swift that have me excited to break ground on a new LLM-powered iOS app:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#the-generable-and-guide-annotations"><code>@Generable</code> and <code>@Guide</code> annotations</a></li>
<li><a href="#the-playground-macro"><code>#Playground</code> macro</a></li>
<li><a href="#streaming-user-interfaces"><code>LanguageModelSession</code>'s async <code>streamResponse</code> function</a></li>
<li><a href="#the-tool-interface"><code>Tool</code> interface</a></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="the-generable-and-guide-annotations">
    <a class="font-bold no-underline text-primary hover:underline" href="#the-generable-and-guide-annotations">The @Generable and @Guide annotations</a>
</h2>
<p>Here's the first snippet:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">@</span><span class="n">Generable</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>You don't have to know Swift to see why this is cool: just tack <code>@Generable</code> onto any struct and you can tell the <code>LanguageModelSession</code> to return that type. No fussing with marshalling and unmarshalling JSON. No custom error handling for when the LLM populates a given value with an unexpected type. You simply declare the type, and it becomes the framework's job to figure out how to color inside the lines.</p>
<p>And if you want to make sure the LLM gets the <em>spirit</em> of a value as well as its basic type, you can prompt it on an attribute-by-attribute basis with <code>@Guide</code>, as shown here:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">@</span><span class="n">Generable</span>

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Thanks to <code>@Guide</code>, you can name your attributes whatever you want and separately document for the LLM what those names mean for the purpose of generating values.</p>

<h2 id="the-playground-macro">
    <a class="font-bold no-underline text-primary hover:underline" href="#the-playground-macro">The #Playground macro</a>
</h2>
<p>My ears perked up when the presenter Richard Wei said, &quot;then I'm going to use the new playground macro in Xcode to preview my non-UI code.&quot; Because when I hear, &quot;preview my non-UI code,&quot; my brain finishes the sentence with, &quot;to get faster feedback.&quot; Seeing magic happen in your app's UI is great, but if going end-to-end to the UI is your <em>only mechanism</em> for getting any feedback from the system at all, forward progress will be unacceptably slow.</p>
<p>Automated tests are one way of getting faster feedback. Working in a REPL is another. Defining a <code>#Playground</code> inside a code listing is now a third tool in that toolbox.</p>
<p>Here's what it might look like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">#</span><span class="n">Playground</span> <span class="p">{</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Which brings up a split view with an interactive set of LLM results, one for each <code>landmark</code> in the set of sample data:</p>

<h2 id="streaming-user-interfaces">
    <a class="font-bold no-underline text-primary hover:underline" href="#streaming-user-interfaces">Streaming user interfaces</a>
</h2>
<p>Users were reasonably mesmerized when they first saw ChatGPT stream its textual responses as it plopped one word in front of another in real-time. In a world of loading screens and all-at-once responses, it was one of the reasons that the current crop of AI assistants immediately felt so life-like. (&quot;The computer is typing—just like me!&quot;)</p>
<p>So, naturally, in addition to being able to await a big-bang <code>respond</code> request, Apple's new <code>LanguageModelSession</code> also provides an async <code>streamResponse</code> function, which looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nv">stream</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">session</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">streamResponse</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">generating</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">Itinerary</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="kc">self</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">  <span class="s">&#34;Generate a </span><span class="si">\(</span><span class="n">dayCount</span><span class="si">)</span><span class="s">-day itinerary to </span><span class="si">\(</span><span class="n">landmark</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="si">)</span><span class="s">. Give it a fun title!&#34;</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">}</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="k">for</span> <span class="k">try</span> <span class="n">await</span> <span class="n">partialItinerary</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="n">stream</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">  <span class="n">itinerary</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">partialItinerary</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The fascinating bit—and what sets this apart from mere text streaming—is that by simply re-assigning the <code>itinerary</code> to the streamed-in <code>partialItinerary</code>, the user interface is able to recompose complex views incrementally. So now, instead of some plain boring text streaming into a chat window, <em>multiple complex UI elements</em> can cohere before your eyes. Which UI elements? Whichever ones you've designed to be driven by the <code>@Generable</code> structs you've demanded the LLM provide. This is where it all comes together:</p>

<p>Scrub to 25:29 in the video and watch this in action (and then re-watch it in slow motion). As a web developer, I can only imagine how many dozens of hours of painstaking debugging it would take me to approximate this effect in JavaScript—only for it to <em>still</em> be hopelessly broken on slow devices and unreliable networks. If this API actually works as well as the demo suggests, then Apple's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/FoundationModels">Foundation Models</a> framework is seriously looking to cash some of the checks Apple wrote over a decade ago when it introduced Swift and more recently, SwiftUI.</p>

<p>When the rumors were finally coalescing around the notion that Apple was going to allow developers to invoke its models on device, I was excited but skeptical. On device meant it would be free and work offline—both of which, great—but <em>how would I handle cases where I needed to search the web or hit an API</em>?</p>
<p>It didn't even occur to me that Apple would be ready to introduce something akin to Model Context Protocol (which Anthropic didn't even <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol">coin until last November</a>!), much less the paradigm of the LLM as an agent calling upon a discrete set of tools able to do more than merely generate text and images.</p>
<p>And yet, that's exactly what they did! The <code>Tool</code> interface, in a slide:</p>

    <a class="font-bold no-underline text-primary hover:underline" href="#why-this-is-exciting">Why this is exciting</a>
</h2>
<p>I'm excited about this stuff, because—even though I was bummed out that none of this came last year—what Apple announced this week <em>couldn't</em> have been released a year ago, because basic concepts like agents invoking tools didn't <em>exist</em> a year ago. The ideas themselves needed more time in the oven. And because Apple bided its time, version one of its Foundation Models framework is looking like a pretty robust initial release and a great starting point from which to build a new app.</p>
<p>It's possible you skimmed this post and are nevertheless <em>not excited</em>. Maybe you follow AI stuff really closely and all of these APIs are old hat to you by now. That's a completely valid reaction. But the thing that's going on here that's significant is not that Apple put out an API that kinda sorta looks like the state of the art as of two or three months ago, it's that <em>this API sits on top of a strongly-typed language and a reactive, declarative UI framework</em> that can take full advantage of generative AI in a way web applications simply can't—at least not without a hobbled-together collection of unrelated dependencies and mountains of glue code.</p>
<p>Oh, and while every other app under the sun is trying to figure out how to reckon with the <em>unbounded</em> costs that come with &quot;AI&quot; translating to &quot;call out to a hilariously-expensive API endpoints&quot;, all of Apple's stuff is completely <em>free</em> for developers. I know a lot of developers are pissed at Apple right now, but I can't think of another moment in time when Apple made such a compelling technical case for building on its platforms specifically and at the exclusion of cross-compiled, multi-platform toolkits like Electron or React Native.</p>
<p>And now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go install some betas and watch my unusually sunny disposition turn on a dime. 🤞</p>]]></content>

</h2>
<p>Users were reasonably mesmerized when they first saw ChatGPT stream its textual responses as it plopped one word in front of another in real-time. In a world of loading screens and all-at-once responses, it was one of the reasons that the current crop of AI assistants immediately felt so life-like. (&quot;The computer is typing—just like me!&quot;)</p>
<p>So, naturally, in addition to being able to await a big-bang <code>respond</code> request, Apple's new <code>LanguageModelSession</code> also provides an async <code>streamResponse</code> function, which looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-swift" data-lang="swift"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nv">stream</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="n">session</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">streamResponse</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">generating</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">Itinerary</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="kc">self</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

So now, instead of some plain boring text streaming into a chat window, <em>multiple complex UI elements</em> can cohere before your eyes. Which UI elements? Whichever ones you've designed to be driven by the <code>@Generable</code> structs you've demanded the LLM provide. This is where it all comes together:</p>

<p>Scrub to 25:29 in the video and watch this in action (and then re-watch it in slow motion). As a web developer, I can only imagine how many dozens of hours of painstaking debugging it would take me to approximate this effect in JavaScript—only for it to <em>still</em> be hopelessly broken on slow devices and unreliable networks. If this API actually works as well as the demo suggests, then Apple's <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/FoundationModels">Foundation Models</a> framework is seriously looking to cash some of the checks Apple wrote over a decade ago when it introduced Swift and more recently, SwiftUI.</p>

    <a class="font-bold no-underline text-primary hover:underline" href="#the-tool-interface">The Tool interface</a>
</h2>
<p>When the rumors were finally coalescing around the notion that Apple was going to allow developers to invoke its models on device, I was excited but skeptical. On device meant it would be free and work offline—both of which, great—but <em>how would I handle cases where I needed to search the web or hit an API</em>?</p>
<p>It didn't even occur to me that Apple would be ready to introduce something akin to Model Context Protocol (which Anthropic didn't even <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol">coin until last November</a>!), much less the paradigm of the LLM as an agent calling upon a discrete set of tools able to do more than merely generate text and images.</p>
<p>And yet, that's exactly what they did! The <code>Tool</code> interface, in a slide:</p>

<h2 id="why-this-is-exciting">
    <a class="font-bold no-underline text-primary hover:underline" href="#why-this-is-exciting">Why this is exciting</a>
</h2>
<p>I'm excited about this stuff, because—even though I was bummed out that none of this came last year—what Apple announced this week <em>couldn't</em> have been released a year ago, because basic concepts like agents invoking tools didn't <em>exist</em> a year ago. The ideas themselves needed more time in the oven. And because Apple bided its time, version one of its Foundation Models framework is looking like a pretty robust initial release and a great starting point from which to build a new app.</p>
<p>It's possible you skimmed this post and are nevertheless <em>not excited</em>. Maybe you follow AI stuff really closely and all of these APIs are old hat to you by now. That's a completely valid reaction. But the thing that's going on here that's significant is not that Apple put out an API that kinda sorta looks like the state of the art as of two or three months ago, it's that <em>this API sits on top of a strongly-typed language and a reactive, declarative UI framework</em> that can take full advantage of generative AI in a way web applications simply can't—at least not without a hobbled-together collection of unrelated dependencies and mountains of glue code.</p>
<p>Oh, and while every other app under the sun is trying to figure out how to reckon with the <em>unbounded</em> costs that come with &quot;AI&quot; translating to &quot;call out to a hilariously-expensive API endpoints&quot;, all of Apple's stuff is completely <em>free</em> for developers. I know a lot of developers are pissed at Apple right now, but I can't think of another moment in time when Apple made such a compelling technical case for building on its platforms specifically and at the exclusion of cross-compiled, multi-platform toolkits like Electron or React Native.</p>
<p>And now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go install some betas and watch my unusually sunny disposition turn on a dime. 🤞</p>]]></summary>

The ideas themselves needed more time in the oven. And because Apple bided its time, version one of its Foundation Models framework is looking like a pretty robust initial release and a great starting point from which to build a new app.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt's possible you skimmed this post and are nevertheless \u003cem\u003enot excited\u003c/em\u003e. Maybe you follow AI stuff really closely and all of these APIs are old hat to you by now. That's a completely valid reaction. But the thing that's going on here that's significant is not that Apple put out an API that kinda sorta looks like the state of the art as of two or three months ago, it's that \u003cem\u003ethis API sits on top of a strongly-typed language and a reactive, declarative UI framework\u003c/em\u003e that can take full advantage of generative AI in a way web applications simply can't—at least not without a hobbled-together collection of unrelated dependencies and mountains of glue code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOh, and while every other app under the sun is trying to figure out how to reckon with the \u003cem\u003eunbounded\u003c/em\u003e costs that come with \u0026quot;AI\u0026quot; translating to \u0026quot;call out to a hilariously-expensive API endpoints\u0026quot;, all of Apple's stuff is completely \u003cem\u003efree\u003c/em\u003e for developers. I know a lot of developers are pissed at Apple right now, but I can't think of another moment in time when Apple made such a compelling technical case for building on its platforms specifically and at the exclusion of cross-compiled, multi-platform toolkits like Electron or React Native.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go install some betas and watch my unusually sunny disposition turn on a dime. 🤞\u003c/p\u003e","id":"https://justin.searls.co/posts/these-4-code-snippets-won-wwdc/","og_image":"https://justin.searls.co/img/social/posts/these-4-code-snippets-won-wwdc.jpg","platform_overrides":{"instagram":{"syndicate":false}},"published_at":"2025-06-11T01:42:56Z","title":"These 4 Code Snippets won WWDC","updated_at":"2025-06-11T10:42:08+09:00","url":"https://justin.searls.co/posts/these-4-code-snippets-won-wwdc/"}]]></posse:post>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you've been following me for the last few years, you've heard all about my move to Orlando<sup>*</sup> and how great I think it is.

<p>Beautiful house. Gated community. Golf course. Lake access. Disney World.</p>
<p>How else do I know this house is good? Because my brother lives there! He's poured his heart and soul into modernizing and updating it since he moved to Orlando in 2022, and it really shows. I suspect it won't sit on the market very long, so if you're interested you should go do the thing and <a href="https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/11425-Claymont-Cir-Windermere-FL-34786/54444611_zpid/">click through to Zillow</a> and then <a href="https://www.pozek.com">contact the realtor</a>.</p>
<p>As our good friend/realtor Ken Pozek puts in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DKkk6vAtuLY/">his incredible overview video</a>, this house comes with everything <em>except</em> compromises<sup>†</sup>:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As some of you know, I moved to Orlando in 2020. But it wasn't so much Orlando as <em>Disney World itself</em>, given our home's relative proximity to the parks and the degree to which we're isolated from most of the &quot;Florida stuff&quot; that comes to mind when I tell people I live in Florida.</p>
<p>One of the great joys of where we live is that I've made a variety of fascinating friends who similarly relocated to central Florida with a degree of intentionality, and one of them is <a href="https://ericdoggett.com">Eric Doggett</a>. Eric is a phenomenally talented photographer, artist, and all-around creative. In fact, if you listen to <a href="/casts/breaking-change">Breaking Change</a>, a big reason it sounds as good as it does is thanks to Eric!</p>
<p>A couple years ago, Eric was admitted into the Disney Fine Art program, and now he officially has <a href="https://disneyfineart.com/collections/eric-doggett">some prints for sale</a>. Check out his announcement video:</p>

<p>If you're a Disney fan and you're the art-buying sort, <strong>go buy some</strong>! I especially love the new Palm Springs motif he's been iterating on most recently.</p>
