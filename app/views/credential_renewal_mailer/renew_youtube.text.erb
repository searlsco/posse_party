Hi there!

Your YouTube connection for POSSE Party needs to be renewed. Google requires apps in "testing" mode to refresh their tokens every 7 days for security.

To renew your YouTube credentials, please click the link below:

<%= @oauth_url %>

This will take you to Google's authorization page where you can grant permission again.

Thanks,

Possy
