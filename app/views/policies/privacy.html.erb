<h1 class="text-2xl font-semibold tracking-tight">Privacy Policy</h1>

<div class="space-y-4 leading-relaxed text-secondary">
  <%= render partial: "preamble", locals: {policy_context: @policy_context} %>

  <p>This policy describes how this self-hosted installation of POSSE Party (the “Software”) handles information on this specific server instance (the “Instance”).</p>

  <p class="p-4 border rounded-lg border-primary bg-secondary/10 text-secondary">
    <span class="font-semibold text-primary">Important context:</span>
    POSSE Party is self-hosted software. There is no central POSSE Party service operating this Instance, and the Software’s maintainers do not have access to your Instance’s database unless you separately provide them access.
  </p>

  <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-primary">Definitions</h2>
  <ul class="pl-5 space-y-1 list-disc">
    <li><span class="font-medium text-primary">Instance</span>: this running copy of the Software on your own server (for example, on your computer, a home server, or a VPS you control).</li>
    <li><span class="font-medium text-primary">Instance Administrator</span>: the person who controls the server, configuration, and database for this Instance.</li>
    <li><span class="font-medium text-primary">Connected Platforms</span>: third-party services you optionally connect for syndication/publishing.</li>
    <li><span class="font-medium text-primary">Personal Data</span>: information that can identify you directly or indirectly (for example, an email address).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-primary">Summary</h2>
  <ul class="pl-5 space-y-1 list-disc">
    <li><span class="font-medium text-primary">No monetization</span>: no ads and no selling of data.</li>
    <li><span class="font-medium text-primary">Local custody</span>: data is stored in the local database and files under the control of the Instance Administrator.</li>
    <li><span class="font-medium text-primary">No central collection</span>: this Instance does not send your data to any central POSSE Party service.</li>
    <li><span class="font-medium text-primary">Optional external transmissions</span>: the Instance communicates externally only when you configure it to do so (for example, fetching feeds or posting to Connected Platforms).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-primary">What data this app stores</h2>
  <p>The Instance may store the following categories of data locally:</p>

  <h3 class="font-semibold text-primary">Account and configuration data</h3>
  <ul class="pl-5 space-y-1 list-disc">
    <li>Account identifiers (for example: email address, username).</li>
    <li>Instance settings and preferences.</li>
    <li>Feed and syndication configuration (for example: target platforms, templates, and rules).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="font-semibold text-primary">Content data</h3>
  <ul class="pl-5 space-y-1 list-disc">
    <li>Feed URLs you configure.</li>
    <li>Posts imported from those feeds (and associated metadata).</li>
    <li>Drafts, queued items, and publishing history (for example: crossposts, timestamps, statuses, and error messages).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="font-semibold text-primary">Connected Platform credentials</h3>
  <ul class="pl-5 space-y-1 list-disc">
    <li>Credentials you provide to Connected Platforms (for example: access tokens or API keys) so the Instance can act on your behalf.</li>
    <li>Information returned by Connected Platforms that is necessary to maintain the connection (for example: account IDs, token scopes, or expiry times), if applicable.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="font-semibold text-primary">Operational and diagnostic data</h3>
  <ul class="pl-5 space-y-1 list-disc">
    <li>Application logs and error traces generated by the Software and hosting environment.</li>
    <li>Depending on how you host and access the Instance, logs may include technical metadata such as IP addresses, user agent strings, request timestamps, and URLs visited within the Instance.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-primary">How data is used</h2>
  <p>Data stored by the Instance is used only to operate the Software as configured by the Instance Administrator, including:</p>
  <ul class="pl-5 space-y-1 list-disc">
    <li>Authenticating you and managing your session.</li>
    <li>Fetching and parsing your configured feed(s).</li>
    <li>Creating, queueing, and publishing crossposts according to your settings.</li>
    <li>Displaying publishing status and error messages.</li>
    <li>Basic troubleshooting and reliability (for example, logs needed to diagnose failures).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-primary">When data leaves this server</h2>
  <p>This Instance does not sell data and does not share data with third parties by default.</p>
  <p>Data may be transmitted externally only in these situations:</p>
  <ol class="pl-5 space-y-1 list-decimal">
    <li>
      <span class="font-medium text-primary">Fetching feeds you configure</span>:
      when you add a feed URL, the Instance makes network requests to retrieve that feed. The feed host may receive standard request metadata (for example: your server’s IP address and request headers).
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="font-medium text-primary">Publishing to Connected Platforms</span>:
      when you configure a connection and enable syndication, the Instance transmits the content you choose to publish (and any metadata required by the platform’s API) to that platform. Connected Platforms operate under their own privacy policies and terms.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="font-medium text-primary">Your infrastructure providers (if any)</span>:
      if you run this Instance on third-party infrastructure (for example: a VPS provider, reverse proxy, or managed database host), that provider may process limited technical data necessary to provide hosting services.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-primary">Cookies and local storage</h2>
  <p>If you access this Instance via a web browser, it may use a session cookie (or similar local storage) to keep you signed in and maintain security protections (for example, CSRF protection). The Instance does not use advertising cookies.</p>

  <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-primary">Data retention</h2>
  <p>Data is retained locally for as long as the Instance Administrator keeps it. Imported content, publishing history, and configuration remain stored unless deleted through the app (where available) or removed from the underlying database/files.</p>
  <p>If you create backups or snapshots, deleted data may persist in those backups until they are rotated or removed.</p>

  <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-primary">Security</h2>
  <p>The Instance Administrator is responsible for securing the server and its data (for example: controlling access to the host machine and database, using HTTPS when appropriate, protecting Connected Platform credentials, and applying updates).</p>
  <p>No method of storage or transmission is completely secure. If the host system is compromised, data stored on this Instance (including Connected Platform credentials) may be exposed.</p>

  <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-primary">Your choices and controls</h2>
  <p>Because this is a self-hosted Instance under your control, you can typically:</p>
  <ul class="pl-5 space-y-1 list-disc">
    <li>Review and change stored configuration and content within the Software.</li>
    <li>Delete content and settings by removing them in the UI (where available) or by deleting the underlying database/files.</li>
    <li>Disable syndication to stop future publishing.</li>
    <li>Revoke Connected Platform access at any time using the third-party platform’s settings, then remove the connection from this Instance.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-primary">Children’s privacy</h2>
  <p>This Instance is not intended for use by children. Do not use this Instance if you are under the age required by your local law to consent to data processing.</p>

  <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-primary">Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>The Instance Administrator may update this policy from time to time. The “Last updated” date reflects the most recent version.</p>

  <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold text-primary">Contact</h2>
  <p>Contact the host of this instance for questions or requests.</p>
