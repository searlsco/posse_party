# Meta Developer App Setup

This guide walks through creating a Meta app in the Meta for Developers portal. You’ll do this once, then use that app to connect POSSE Party to [Threads](/docs/account_setup/threads.md), [Instagram](/docs/account_setup/instagram.md), and/or [Facebook Pages](/docs/account_setup/facebook.md).

## What POSSE Party Needs From You

Nothing from this guide alone. You’ll collect platform-specific credentials in the [Threads account setup](/docs/account_setup/threads.md), [Instagram account setup](/docs/account_setup/instagram.md), and [Facebook Pages account setup](/docs/account_setup/facebook.md) guides.
