Read this first:

- Every change must be tested thoroughly.
- For fixes, include two commits: one adding a failing test that demonstrates the bug, and the next making that test pass.
- Working code and great ideas are not a guarantee of merge. PRs may be closed without comment or review.

Before requesting review, confirm:

- [ ] New or updated tests cover the change
- [ ] The full test suite passes locally with CI=true
- [ ] The PR description explains the behavior change and how to reproduce it
